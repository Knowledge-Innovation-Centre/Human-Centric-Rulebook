# Signature example

To start the example, first install an HTTP server for serving static HTML files.

```sh
$ npm -g i serve
```

Start the HTTP server from this directory.

```sh
$ serve .
```

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhostL8080`. This should display
the `index.html` file.

Make sure you have MetaMask plugin installed, then try signing a message by
inserting an arbitrary content in the input and pressing the button. Note that
some results might be displayed in the developer's console.
